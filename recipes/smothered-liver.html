        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet
                    
                    over medium heat. Saute onions until
                    
                    soft, but not browned. Remove from pan
                    
                    using a slotted spoon, and set aside.
                    
                    Slice the liver into serving size pieces,
                    
                    and remove any membrane.</li>
                <li>In a shallow dish, mix together the
                    
                    flour, salt and pepper. Dredge the liver
                    
                    in the flour mixture, and place into the
                    
                    hot skillet. Brown the liver quickly on
                    
                    each side. Place reserved onions on top
                    
                    of liver pieces. Pour the tomato sauce
                    
                    and water over everything in the pan,
                    
                    lifting the liver pieces to let the
                    
                    tomato sauce coat the bottom of the pan.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the oregano over everything,
                    
                    and simmer over low heat for 8 to 10
                    
                    minutes, stirring occasionally. Adjust
                    
                    salt and pepper to taste. Be careful not
                    
                    to overcook</li>
